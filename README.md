I began the project by using a basic Bash script capable of generating five passwords, with the length determined by the user's preference. Following that, I incorporated input validation into the script to detect incorrect entries, prompting the script to display an error message.

Once I had done that, I decided to add a script to save the passwords generated onto a text file that I called passwords.txt. Initially, it posed a challenge as the passwords stored in the file didn't match those generated. This led me to discover the solution: arrays. With arrays, you can store multiple values under a single variable name, providing a tidy solution to my dilemma.  I also added a script to ask the user whether they would like to save the generated passwords or not and to echo an appropriate response.
